<a id="10-weeks-biohackacademy" class="anchor" href="#10-weeks-biohackacademy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>10 weeks biohackacademy</h3><p>It has been an interesting 10 weeks at the Biohack academy. We learned how to inoculate microbes, about cells, Dna - Rna - Proteins, the latest gene-editing technology <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673">CRISPR</a>, how to build all the machines you could need in a <a href="http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha2/">wetlab</a> and a few things more. </p>

<p>To be honest, for growing <a href="http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha2/annex/culture-collection/">the microbes</a> available at the Waag, you dont really need an incubator, because these organisms will grow quiet easily on room temperature and are not that fragile. You can find all you need to make one <a href="http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha2/class/3//">here</a>. <br>The reason that I wanted to make an incubator is to do tests. I have read a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/sewage-mozart-germany/">a few articles</a> that claim that playing mozart to microbes in a sewage system made them grow faster. I would like to test the difference between Mozart and house and maybe some other music on the growth of the microbes. With experiments circumstances always need to be the same. The incubator is finally finished now, with some help and patience from Pieter because I didnt manage the electronical bit. It looks the same as the one in the repository, with the difference that I made 2 windows for it, one dark and one transparant because some microbes prefer to grow in the dark. In the repository there are two recommended temperature sensors, one digital and one analog. If you buy the digital sensor you will need to change the code for the arduino, which I will post later. Also, you will need a extra 4K7 resistor. For the moment I am concentrating on making "portraits" and will continue with the tests later.</p>

<p>At the moment I am researching the Microbiome. Microbes, mainly bacteria, outnumber human cells in our body by 10 to 1. Scientists have identified 10,000 different species of bacteria, fungi and viruses that live in and on the body. These microbes usually coexist with the human body in peaceful harmony, playing important roles in health, such as aiding digestion and preventing harmful infections. Understanding which microbes live where may help scientists understand how to treat people with disorders, including eczema and digestive disorders, that have been linked to specific kinds of bacteria. 
These microbial communities are collectively known as the human microbiome. At the moment I am making "portraits" of my costudents to see how we look like at microbial scale. </p>
