<a id="10-weeks-biohackacademy" class="anchor" href="#10-weeks-biohackacademy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>10 weeks biohackacademy</h3><p>It has been an interesting 10 weeks at the Biohack academy. We learned about microbes, cells, Dna - Rna - Proteins, the latest gene-editing technology <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-the-disruptor-1.17673">CRISPR</a>, and how to build all the machines you could need in a <a href="http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha2/">wetlab</a>.</p>

<p>To be honest, for growing <a href="http://biohackacademy.github.io/bha2/annex/culture-collection/">the microbes</a> available at the Waag, you dont really need an incubator, because these organisms will grow quiet easily on room temperature and are not that fragile. The reason that I wanted to make an incubator is to do tests. I want to test if music has influence on the growth of the microbes. And with tests the circumstances always need to be the same. It is finally finished now, with some help and patience from Pieter. For the moment I am concentrating on making "portraits" and will continue with the tests later.</p>

<p>At the moment I am researching the Microbiome. Microbes, mainly bacteria, outnumber human cells in our body by 10 to 1. Scientists have identified 10,000 different species of bacteria, fungi and viruses that live in and on the body. These microbes usually coexist with the human body in peaceful harmony, playing important roles in health, such as aiding digestion and preventing harmful infections. Understanding which microbes live where may help scientists understand how to treat people with disorders, including eczema and digestive disorders, that have been linked to specific kinds of bacteria. 
These microbial communities are collectively known as the human microbiome. At the moment I am making "portraits" of my costudents to see how we look like at microbial scale. </p>
